# Karma

Our implementation of the Karma game in Java.

## What works:

- Player creation.
- Dealing cards to players.
- Keeping track of the deck as players add and remove cards.
- Internal calculation of Shannon entropy.
- Riffle shuffle.
- Simple shuffle.
- Players making plays.

## What does not work:

- Everything else, pretty much.
- No, like, everything else.
- We're being serious.
- Playing the game itself is iffy at times -- sometimes you may get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
- We haven't actually played to the point where you can win the game, so we're not sure if that works either.

It's been a pretty painful journey in the creation of this game. So... yeah.
